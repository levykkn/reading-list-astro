        Welcome to Reading List, a curated platform dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. We believe that behind every great course of study lies a foundational reading list, and our mission is to make those essential resources accessible, clear, and available to learners everywhere.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        In a world overflowing with information, finding a clear path to understanding can be a challenge. We collaborate with educators and experts to assemble fundamental reading lists for a wide range of subjects. Each collection is more than just a list of books; it's a guided journey through a field of study, designed to build a strong intellectual foundation from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We focus on timeless texts and essential authors, believing that a solid base is the best starting point for any intellectual exploration.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        This project was born from a simple idea: the right book at the right time can change everything. We wanted to create a quiet, focused space free from distractions, where learning and discovery take center stage. By providing direct access to these thoughtfully selected texts, we hope to empower students, professionals, and lifelong learners to explore new horizons with confidence and clarity.
      </p>
